# Andrew Liebchen

I’m a professional designer and amateur developer. During the day, I make beautiful and useful digital experiences for people at [Persista](https://persista.com). Previously, I've designed and developed products at [OpenGov](https://opengov.com) to advance civic financial reporting and at [FDN](http://gofdn.com), to make hedge fund due diligence better.

At night I ride my bike, hang out with my cats, make dinner for my wife, and build silly things for the internet.

I've studied architecture at [RISD](http://risd.edu). You can find me on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/andrewliebchen/), [Medium](https://medium.com/@andrewliebchen), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/andrewliebchen), [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/andrewliebchen), and [Github](https://github.com/andrewliebchen). I live in Mountain View and work in San Francisco.

## FAQs

### If you’re a designer, why didn’t you bother to design this website?
I’ve gone that route with every portfolio/blog I’ve ever had. While it’s great to express yourself with the design of your portfolio itself, I find that 80% of the effort goes into the site design, development, and devops, with only 20% going toward content. That’s exhausting. The stack for this site is a straight-forward Jekyll setup, with little design and development work. Deployment is via a simple push to Github Pages.

### Does Liebchen really mean “sweetheart?”
Yup, though I think it literally means “love child.” I don’t speak German, and I was adopted so... I try to live up to my name, but I’m not always successful.

### What is your favorite gif?
Of all time? Probably got to be cat in the shark costume on a Roomba chases a duck:
