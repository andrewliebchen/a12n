I moved to California and started at OpenGov in January of 2014 😎. My primary focus was on their new line of platform products that would allow governments to easily view and analyze their financial information internally. OpenGov had launched as a public transparency product, but ultimately our goal was to transform the way governments dealt with finances, which meant moving focusing more on “enterprise” features.

Building on the transparency tools developed for citizens, I worked on a several products including internal reporting, data management, and budgeting. I functioned as a designer/developer in cross-functional teams that included a product manager, domain expert, front- and back-end developers, and data scientists.

## Making data management easy

One of the major new products I designed was a data manager that would set the stage for simple uploading, syncing, and control between OpenGov and a financial system of record (usually an on-premises ERP system).

The first UI challenge was making the process of mapping data fields to OpenGov’s system as simple as possible. I sketched some vignettes to illustrate a few possibilities 👇

For the larger application flow, the product manager and I developed storyboards. Our goal was to use these to help evaluate the general upload and management process with our customers 👇

These storyboards grew into early mockups to give our engineering team enough to begin work on the new application 👇

As work and testing progressed, we honed and refined the design. At this point, I was working closely with the developers and contributing React and CSS code 👇
