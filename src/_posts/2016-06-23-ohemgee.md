# OhEmGee

If you work on digital projects, you’re probably familiar with Invision. It seems like it’s ubiquitous at this point as the way for designers to share their work with other project stakeholders. I’ve been a user of Invision for years, since their launch as a quick and easy way to upload projects and get feedback to now. With their recent acquisitions and releases, it seems like their trying to build for a future where product design is done completely in the browser, but that’s a topic for another day.

OhEmGee grew out of some frustrations I had when it came to using Invision:

* I don’t need use Invision hot-linking features to make clickable mockups, but I love it’s comment system.
* It’s frustrating that I can’t add descriptions to projects or images.
* You can’t comment on the project as a whole, only individual images.

So, I set out to build a replacement. I got pretty far along, here are some of the features:

* Drag and drop image upload.
* Project and image descriptions.
* Comments on the project- and image- level.
* Comments can be attached to specific points on an image.
* A quick system for leaving a negative or positive reaction.
* Permissions and user management.

There are critical features missing, and it’s a little clunky. Maybe someday I get around to wrapping it up 💁.
