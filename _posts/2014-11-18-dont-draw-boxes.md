title:  "Don't draw boxes"
---

I spend a lot of time drawing boxes. Since I design things that are made for the internet, and things on the internet are made of boxes, I have to draw boxes on paper, whiteboards, and computer screens to communicate with everyone else who has an interest in how those boxes look and function. I know something about drawing boxes, and its one of the few things I'm confident I'm pretty good at.

I'm not going to say you're drawing boxes "wrong" because there is no wrong way to draw a box. In fact, it's pretty great that you are communicating by drawing in the first place. Drawing allows you to give your thoughts a form without much to slow it down...there's no "configuring" an drawing you do by hand, no choosing the proper libraries, units, or format...you just DRAW.

I just think your boxes are probably ugly. The main problem is that you're drawing boxes. You heard that right, you're drawing boxes badly because you're drawing boxes. Drawing boxes is hard when you try to draw the whole box in one go, so I suggest drawing a bunch of little things that add up to a box.

It's simpler than it sounds, and less like some kind of zen mantra, believe me. What is the most irreducible part of a box? Points make up lines make up boxes. So draw points first.

Connect those points with lines. Repeat. You might skip the drawing points part, but if you think of lines as connection two points, you'll always draw better lines.

When you start to draw boxes as collections of discrete lines, you'll notice that you'll tend to extend your lines beyond the corners of the box. I think this is actually a great practice. It really emphasizes those corners...and after all, what is a box if it's not defined by its corners?

The key to drawing a box? Don't draw a box. Draw all the parts of the box.
