This weekend I rallied and pulled together a project an open source project I've been planning to release for awhile. It's called [**BTSTRP**](http://andrewliebchen.github.io/BTSTRP/), and it's literally the smallest UI framework.

"Literally the smallest UI framework" is a little tounge-in-cheek. When authors say their framework is small they usually mean its been optimized to produce a [small file](https://github.com/mrmrs/tachyons/#file-sizes) or that it's a [minimal framework](http://purecss.io/) that doesn't aim to do too much. **BTSTRP** is different because it's actually a UI framework that's intended to produce down-scaled "thumbnails" of UIs, rather than fully-scaled and functional websites.

UI thumbnails are great because they give a "20,000 foot" view of a UI or user flow. Specific details of the interface aren't important, thumbnails are more about the general relationships between parts, the relationship between parts and the whole, and the massing of UI forms. This kind of zoomed out view is difficult to do when you're designing in the browser, because you're always working at full scale. The motivation for **BTSTRP** is to have the ability to "sketch" in the browser.

**BTSTRP** is a fork of [Bootstrap-sass](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass), so it has most of Bootstrap's [components](http://getbootstrap.com/components/) and [functionality](http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/). All units are reduced by a factor of 0.25. Text would be too distracting and isn't really the point I replaced Helvetica with [BLOKK](http://blokkfont.com/).

What's next for **BTSTRP**? Today, its great for thumbnails. Ultimately, it'd be really great to string together a few thumbnails into a storyboard that describes a full UI flow, like a comic strip. Not sure what the technical implementation of this would be. It could be as simple as a grid system for a series of thumbnails, or it could be more complicated and include a build system to string together thumbnail templates.

Why not give **BTSTRP** a try? You can install it with [npm](https://www.npmjs.org/package/btstrp), [Bower](http://bower.io/search/?q=btstrp), or just download it from [Github](https://github.com/andrewliebchen/BTSTRP).
