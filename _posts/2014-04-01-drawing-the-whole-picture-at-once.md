I took a figure drawing class my freshman year in college. The instructor had a mantra, "draw the entire picture at once!" He said it over and over, and it took me a long time to understand what he meant. How is it possible to draw the entire picture at once?

Eventually, I understood the key to drawing the entire picture at once: progressive refinement. I realized that the composition should appear on my drawing board like a camera slowly slowly focussing in on its subject. In the first pass, you capture the relationship between all objects in the composition. Then, capture the composition's general areas of light and shadow. In a series of passes, gradually refine and clarify: edges become sharper, shading between highlight and shadow show more tone, and on and on. You literally have to draw the entire picture in a series of passes, with each pass moving up a scale of visual refinement.

Frank Chimero's introductory post on his new website describes his desire to have his website seem "homely." He draws a lot of comparisons to architects building their own homes (he mentions the Eames and their Case Study House particularly). The thing he's missing is that works of architecture are not sprung fully formed from the architects mind to that vacant lot down the street, complete with a certificate of occupancy. Buildings are built. In front of everyone.

That's what this site is. It's a blog, but I'm going to build it in full view of everyone. Right now it's ugly (you could say call it "default"). Over time, I'm going to change that, so the process of making this site will be a slow-motion show and tell of web design and development.
