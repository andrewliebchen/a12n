# OpenGov's Data Manager

OpenGov is transforming the way local and state governments access and analyze public finances. They launched as a [consumer product](https://paloalto.opengov.com/) aimed at improving public financial transparency, empowering citizens to explore every nook and cranny of a city’s budget.

### Making data management easy

Ultimately, OpenGov’s broader mission required more sophisticated “enterprise”-grade tools for the governments themselves. I moved to California in 2014 to help OpenGov design and build these tools 😎.

## Goals
* Enable government employees, accountants, or analysts simple data uploading, syncing, and control between OpenGov and a financial system of record (usually an on-premises ERP system). Sample job story: _“When unaudited returns are ready, I’d like to add them to OpenGov, so everyone is working with the latest data.”_
* Shift user’s mental model from a spreadsheet-based system to database and queries. _“When I’m adding to data to OpenGov, show me how my data is being organized by OpenGov, so I can understand how OpenGov works.”_
* Provide a flexible system that could accept all kinds of datasets from transactions, to dog licensing records that link back to a central Chart of Accounts. _“When I add a new dataset to OpenGov, I’d like to define how the dataset relates to my CoA, so I can understand the data in relation to all the other data I’ve already uploaded.”_
* Give analysts quick access to all data, current an historical. _“When I need to answer a question about past spending, I’d like to be able to quickly query my datasets, so that I can provide a timely answer.”_

## Challenges and constaints
The Data Manager was one of OpenGov’s oldest software products. Before it was opened to GA, it had been used internally to upload and manage customer data visible on public transparency sites. Not only would we set out to rebuild this system from the ground up while maintaining existing functionality, we wanted to pave the way for a more capable and complete future version of the product. Our design process was continually shifting between what the Data Manager would be in at the end of next sprint and what it could be at the end of the next year.

## Design process

### Vignettes
We started by designing and building an MVP of the basic uploading, mapping, and management functionality that would be the core interaction of the product. The UI/UX challenge was making the process of mapping data fields to OpenGov’s system as simple as possible. I sketched some vignettes to illustrate a few possibilities 👇

### Storyboards
For the larger application flow, the product manager and I developed storyboards. Our goal was to use these to help evaluate the general upload and management process with our customers 👇

### MVP First draft
These storyboards grew into early mockups to give our engineering team enough to begin work on the new application 👇

### MVP Final mockups
As work and testing progressed, we honed and refined the design. At this point, I was working closely with the developers and contributing React and CSS code 👇

### Looking to the future
Throughout the process, I set aside to consolidate ideas about the future of the Data Manager based on feedback from users of the MVP, the engineering team, our domain experts, and other stakeholders. 👇
