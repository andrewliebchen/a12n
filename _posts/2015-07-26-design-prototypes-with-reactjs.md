title:  "Design prototypes with ReactJS"
---

I recently threw together slides for a talk about design prototyping with [ReactJS](http://facebook.github.io/react/)
for the F8 Design meetup. If you're interested, [check out the slides](http://andrewliebchen.github.io/prototype-with-reactjs).

I try to make the case first for designing in the browser with working prototypes,
and then why React makes building prototypes really easy.
There are four basic concepts necessary to put together a design prototype
with React: components, `props`, `state`, and events.
The slides cover introduce these concepts and present simple examples to illustrate them.

For more depth, check out the presentation [repo on Github](https://github.com/andrewliebchen/prototype-with-reactjs).
Check out the [resources section](http://andrewliebchen.github.io/prototype-with-reactjs/#48)
of the presentation for me in-depth information.

I'm a true believer in the power of design prototypes, especially those built in code.
If I can summon the sustained interest, I'd like to figure out how to develop a resource
that could turn more designers on to prototyping with React.
