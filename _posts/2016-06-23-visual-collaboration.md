# Visual collaboration tool

If you work on digital projects, you’re probably familiar with [Invision](https://www.invisionapp.com/). It seems like it’s ubiquitous at this point as the way for designers to share their work with other project stakeholders. I’ve been a user of Invision for years, since their launch as a quick and easy way to upload projects and get feedback to now. With their recent acquisitions and releases, it seems like their trying to build for a future where product design is done completely in the browser, but that’s a topic for another day.

This tool grew out of some frustrations I had when it came to using Invision:

* I don’t need use Invision hot-linking features to make clickable mockups, but I love it’s comment system.
* It’s frustrating that I can’t add descriptions to projects or images.
* You can’t comment on the project as a whole, only individual images.

So, I set out to build a replacement. I got pretty far along, here are some of the features:

* Drag and drop image upload.
* Project and image descriptions.
* Comments on the project- and image- level.
* Comments can be attached to specific points on an image.
* A quick system for leaving a negative or positive reaction.
* Permissions and user management.

There are critical features missing, and it’s a little clunky. Maybe someday I get around to wrapping it up 💁.
