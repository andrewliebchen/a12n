# Liebchen is German for "Sweetheart."

I’m a professional designer and developer. Currently, I'm a product designer at 😎 [Meta Reality Labs](http://quest.com/) where I'm working on bringing the excitement of VR to 2D on our 📱 [mobile app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/oculus/id1366478176). Before that, I made beautiful and useful digital experiences for people at [Persista](https://persista.com). Before _that_, I designed and developed products at 🏛 [OpenGov](https://opengov.com) to advance civic financial reporting and at 💰[FDN](http://gofdn.com) to improve hedge fund due diligence.

I live in SF, I have three cats, and I love making things. I've studied architecture at 🎨 [RISD](http://risd.edu). You can find me on 🐣 [Twitter](https://twitter.com/andrewliebchen) and 💻 [Github](https://github.com/andrewliebchen).

## FAQs

### Have you got a resume?

Yep, who doesn't? Since I'm not looking for a new job right now, you'll have to [find me on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewliebchen/) if you want to see where I worked in 2005.

### If you’re a designer, why didn’t you bother to design this website?

I’ve gone that route with every portfolio/blog I’ve ever had. While it’s great to express yourself with the design of your portfolio itself, I find that 80% of the effort goes into the site design, development, and devops, with only 20% going toward content. That’s exhausting. The stack for this site is a straight-forward Jekyll setup, with little design and development work. Deployment is via a simple push to Github Pages.

### Does Liebchen really mean “Sweetheart?”

Yup, though I think it literally means “love child.” I don’t speak German, and I was adopted so... I try to live up to my name, but I’m not always successful.

### What is your favorite gif?

Of all time? Probably has to be cat in the shark costume on a Roomba chasing a duck:
