      <h2>Experience</h2>

      <h3>Senior Product Designer at Meta Reality Labs</h3>

        <i>Sep 2016 — Jan 2020</i><br />
        Designed and built internal HR reporting and data products used by tens
        of thousands of Facebook employees worldwide. For example, at one point
        I worked on a kind of internal LinkedIn, which helped facilitate
        internal transfers. Later, I helped launch a product to help managers
        support their people.

        explore, and plan their public finances. First major project involved

      <h2>FAQs</h2>

      <h3>
        If you’re a designer, why didn’t you bother to design this website?
      </h3>

      <p>
        I’ve gone that route with every portfolio/blog I’ve ever had. Nowadays,
        I just have better things to do. This site a static HTML page and a
        stylesheet, deployed thanks to Github Pages. The stylesheet is minimally
        invasive, making surgical changes to defaults to improve the reading
        experience.
      </p>

      <h3>Does Liebchen really mean “Sweetheart?”</h3>

      <p>
        Yup, though I think it literally means “love child.” I don’t speak
        German, but I try to live up to my name. Maybe it's my a koan.
